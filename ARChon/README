To install {boQwI'} on Windows, OS X, or Chrome OS, you first need to install ARChon:
https://archon-runtime.github.io/

As of Mar. 2015, this has been tested to work with ARChon 2.1.0 beta.
1. Download the file "http://archon.vf.io/ARChon-v2.1.0-x86_64.zip" (or a later version) and unzip it in a directory, e.g., "~/chrome-extensions" (whatever is appropriate for your system).
2. Download the file "boQwI'_ARChon_package-2015-03-16.zip" (or a later version).
3. In Chrome, go to the Extensions tab, enable "Developer Mode", then select "Load unpacked extensions".
4. First install ARChon, then install {boQwI'}.

{boQwI'} should now appear under the "Apps" menu.
