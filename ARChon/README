Using ARChon:
=============

To install {boQwI'} on Windows, OS X, or Chrome OS, you first need to install ARChon:
https://archon-runtime.github.io/

As of Nov. 2015, this has been tested to work with ARChon 2.1.0 beta.
1. Download the file "http://archon.vf.io/ARChon-v2.1.0-x86_64.zip" (or a later version) and unzip it in a directory, e.g., "~/chrome-extensions" (whatever is appropriate for your system).
2. Download the file "boQwI'_ARChon_package-2015-11-18.zip" (or a later version).
3. In Chrome, go to the Extensions tab, enable "Developer Mode", then select "Load unpacked extensions".
4. First install ARChon, then install {boQwI'}.

{boQwI'} should now appear under the "Apps" menu.

To create the ARChon package to begin with, it's sufficient to use the ARChon Packager app from the installed (release) version of boQwI'.

Alternative using Google's App Runtime for Chrome (beta):
=========================================================

1. Install the ARC Welder Chrome extension.
2. Use it to package the (release) APK file.
3. Upload it to the Chrome store.
