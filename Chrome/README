Running {boQwI'} using Google's App Runtime for Chrome (beta):
==============================================================

NOTE: This method is INCOMPATIBLE with the ARChon Runtime for Chrome. If you
have that installed, you must uninstall it first. Alternatively, see below.

If you are running Chrome OS, you can install {boQwI'} directly from the Chrome
web store:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/boqwi/bfahgkmmeilabbfdhacmeakehfcpgcej

Otherwise, you can use these instructions to install {boQwI'} on any computer
running the desktop version of Chrome. As of Nov. 2015, this has been tested to
work with App Runtime for Chrome 46.5021.478.18.
1. Install App Runtime for Chrome (beta):
   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/app-runtime-for-chrome-be/mfaihdlpglflfgpfjcifdjdjcckigekc
   OR install ARC Welder (this includes App Runtime for Chrome):
   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arc-welder/emfinbmielocnlhgmfkkmkngdoccbadn
2. Download the latest {boQwI'} for Chrome package. For example:
   https://github.com/De7vID/klingon-assistant/blob/master/Chrome/KlingonAssistant-for-Chrome-v294.zip?raw=true
3. Unzip this into a subdirectory in the appropriate directory on your system
   (where you normally put Chrome extensions), e.g.,
   "~/chrome-extensions/KlingonAssistant/".
4. In Chrome, go to the Extensions tab, or type the following into the omnibar:
   chrome://extensions/
5. Enable "Developer mode", select "Load unpacked extension...", and choose the
   directory you used in Step #3.
6. Optionally, disable "Developer mode" after the installation is complete.

Note that the {boQwI'} for Chrome package is identical to the non-TTS release
version on Android.

Alternative method using ARChon:
================================

If you need to have the ARChon Runtime for Chrome installed for some reason
(because of other apps), it is possible to run {boQwI'} using ARChon. To do so,
install the "ARChon Packager" app on a device on which {boQwI'} is also
installed, and use it to create an ARChon package for {boQwI'}.

NOTE: This method is INCOMPATIBLE with Google's App Runtime for Chrome (beta).
If you have that installed, you must uninstall it first.

As of Nov. 2015, this has been tested to work with ARChon 2.1.0 beta.
1. Download the file "http://archon.vf.io/ARChon-v2.1.0-x86_64.zip" (or a later
   version) and unzip it into a directory, e.g., "~/chrome-extensions" (whatever
   is appropriate for your system).
2. Unzip your {boQwI'} ARChon package into the same directory.
3. In Chrome, go to Extensions tab, enable "Developer Mode", then select "Load unpacked extensions".
4. First install ARChon, then install {boQwI'}.
