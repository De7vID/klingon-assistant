  <string name="topic_introduction">Welcome!</string>
  <string name="body_introduction"><![CDATA[This course is an introduction to the Klingon language created by Dr. Marc Okrand for {Star Trek:src} and used in the films and TV series, most recently {Discovery:src}. It is assumed that you are in possession of {The Klingon Dictionary:src}, preferably the 1992 edition which includes an Addendum. In addition to most of the known vocabulary, this book also contains a largely complete description of the grammar. If you don\'t have it, go and purchase it now!<br/>
<br/>
Other works by Dr. Okrand, such as {The Klingon Way:src} and {Klingon for the Galactic Traveler:src}, are also highly recommended. If you want to hear the sounds of spoken Klingon, the audiotapes {Conversational Klingon:src} and {Power Klingon:src} are essential. For more advanced students, additional clarifications on grammar and more vocabulary may be found in {HolQeD:src}, the journal of the Klingon Language Institute. The KLI also maintains a list of vocabulary revealed or expanded upon after the publication of {KGT:src}.<br/>
<br/>
The {Star Trek:src} films which have a fair amount of spoken Klingon are {Star Trek III:src}, {Star Trek V:src}, and {Star Trek VI:src}. The series {Discovery:src} also has a large amount of spoken Klingon dialogue. (Dr. Okrand did not work on {Discovery:src}, but its dialogue was translated by expert speakers Robyn Stewart and Alan Anderson. Klingon subtitles for the show were written by Klingon teacher Lieven Litaer.)<br/>

  <string name="body_somebody_does_something_1"><![CDATA[As you may recall, a verb by itself just means that he/she/it is or they are performing the action described by the verb. For example, {HIv:sen} means \"he/she/it attacks\" or \"they attack\". To say that the Klingon attacks, you put the word for Klingon after the verb, like this: {HIv tlhIngan:sen} \"the Klingon attacks\". This can also mean \"a Klingon attacks\".<br/>
