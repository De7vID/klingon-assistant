  <string name="topic_introduction">Welcome!</string>
  <string name="body_introduction"><![CDATA[This course is an introduction to the Klingon language created by Dr. Marc Okrand for {Star Trek:src} and used in the films and TV series, most recently {Discovery:src}. It is assumed that you are in possession of {The Klingon Dictionary:src}, preferably the 1992 edition which includes an Addendum. In addition to most of the known vocabulary, this book also contains a largely complete description of the grammar. If you don\'t have it, go and purchase it now!<br/>
<br/>
Other works by Dr. Okrand, such as {The Klingon Way:src} and {Klingon for the Galactic Traveler:src}, are also highly recommended. If you want to hear the sounds of spoken Klingon, the audiotapes {Conversational Klingon:src} and {Power Klingon:src} are essential. For more advanced students, additional clarifications on grammar and more vocabulary may be found in {HolQeD:src}, the journal of the Klingon Language Institute. The KLI also maintains a list of vocabulary revealed or expanded upon after the publication of {KGT:src}.<br/>
<br/>
The {Star Trek:src} films which have a fair amount of spoken Klingon are {Star Trek III:src}, {Star Trek V:src}, and {Star Trek VI:src}. The series {Discovery:src} also has a large amount of spoken Klingon dialogue. (Dr. Okrand did not work on {Discovery:src}, but its dialogue was translated by expert speakers Robyn Stewart and Alan Anderson. Klingon subtitles for the show were written by Klingon teacher Lieven Litaer.)<br/>
<br/>
One final word of warning: Do <b><i>not</i></b> rely on machine translation for Klingon. Software which can automatically translate between Klingon and another language does not exist. The only thing which can translate Klingon is a person who is competent in the language.<br/>

  <string name="body_a_few_nouns"><![CDATA[Okay, now that we\'ve seen some verbs, let\'s look at some nouns.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some nouns for different kinds of people:]]></string>

  <string name="topic_somebody_does_something">The Klingon attacks</string>
  <string name="body_somebody_does_something_1"><![CDATA[As you may recall from the previous section, a verb by itself just means that he/she/it is or they are performing the action described by the verb. For example, {HIv:sen} means <i>he/she/it attacks</i> or <i>they attack</i>. To say that the Klingon attacks, put the word for Klingon after the verb, like this:<br/>
<br/>
{HIv tlhIngan:sen} <i>the Klingon attacks</i>.<br/>
<br/>
Klingon does not have articles (a, the), so this can also mean <i>a Klingon attacks</i>.<br/>

  <string name="topic_simple_prefixes">I study, we learn</string>
  <string name="body_simple_prefixes_1"><![CDATA[In the previous section, you learned that a verb by itself means <i>he/she/it does something</i> or <i>they do something</i>. To say <i>I do something</i> or <i>you do something</i>, you have to change the verb slightly.<br/>
<br/>
In English, you change the ending of a verb to indicate who is doing something: <i>I sleep</i>, <i>you sleep</i>, but <i>he/she/it sleep<u>s</u></i>. In Klingon, you change the beginning of the verb by adding a prefix. The prefix indicates both who or what is doing something (the subject), and if applicable, to whom or what the action is being done (the object).<br/>
<br/>
Here are four prefixes which are used when there is no object.]]></string>
  <string name="body_simple_prefixes_2"><![CDATA[For example, when combined with the verb {Qong:v} <i>sleep</i>, we get {jIQong:sen} <i>I sleep</i>, {bIQong:sen} <i>you sleep</i>, {maQong:sen} <i>we sleep</i>, and {SuQong:sen} <i>you (plural) sleep</i>.<br/>
<br/>
Following the convention used in {TKD:src}, we will write the absence of a prefix as {0:v:suff} when we need to present it alongside non-empty prefixes. As you learned earlier, the absence of a prefix is used to indicate that the subject is <i>he/she/it</i> or <i>they</i> and the object is <i>none</i>.]]></string>

  <string name="body_simple_prefixes_3"><![CDATA[Have you been paying attention? Which of the following means <i>I study</i>?]]></string>
