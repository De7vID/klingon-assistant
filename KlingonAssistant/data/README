The latest data is to be found in mem-*.xml.  Edits should be made to these
files, then generate_db.sh should be run to generate the database binary,
which is a SQLite3 database file stored in ../app/src/main/assets/qawHaq.db.

Alternatively, the database file can be opened in SQLite Manager (a Firefox
plugin).

To run a .sql file on this database, use the sqlitebrowser.
