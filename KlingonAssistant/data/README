The latest data is to be found in mem-*.xml.  Edits should be made to these
files, then reconstruct.sh should be run to generate the merged file mem.xml.
The data should then be copied into ../asserts/qawHaq.db, which is a SQLite3
database file.

To do so, open the database file in SQLite Manager (a Firefox plugin), clear
the "mem" table, then import the XML file.  Close the database, then be sure to
open it in sqlitebrowser and compact it.

To run a .sql file on this database, use the sqlitebrowser.
