The latest data is to be found in mem.xml.  Edits should be made to this file,
then copied into ../asserts/qawHaq.db, which is a SQLite3 database file.

To do so, open the database file in SQLite Manager (a Firefox plugin), clear the
"mem" table, then import the XML file.  Close the database, then be sure to open
it in sqlitebrowser and compact it.

To run a .sql file on this database, use the sqlitebrowser.
