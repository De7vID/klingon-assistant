                       anim: a type of animal (a specific animal, rather than a
                             generic like "fish" or "bird"); assumed fictional
                       archaic: {no' Hol}, obsolete, or used only ceremonially
                       deriv: derived or constructed from other entries; enables
                              grammar analysis link in entry

                       reg: regional
                       food: related to eating or drinking
                       inv: invectives, swear words
                       slang: a slang word or phrase
                       weap: weapons or weapon-related (for verbs, this marks
                             those which are used exclusively for combat); if
                             fictional, must mark as fic also
                             TODO: rename to "fight" to be more generic
                     metadata tags:
                       alt: alternative spelling (immediately link to other
                            entry, which is given in the definition field)
                       fic (fictional): a fictional object or concept
                       hyp: hypothesised (isn't known to exist from canon);
                            typically entry name should end in "?"
                       extcan: extended canon (appears in a Star Trek novel or
                               other media, but not known to be from MO)
                       nolink: used in definition of another entry to prevent
                               linking

    definition     = the definition in English of the entry
                     - if "hyp", and meaning is uncertain, end with "?"
                     - if "alt", then the definition is the primary entry_name in {}

    synonyms       = synonymous entries in Klingon
    antonyms       = antonymous entries in Klingon
    see_also       = related words, etc.
                     (should not include words already linked in the visible notes)
    notes          = visible notes
    hidden_notes   = notes which are displayed in a smaller font, and which may
                     optionally be hidden
                     (use XML comments for *really* invisible notes)
    components     = if entry is constructed, list components here
    examples       = list examples; long examples should be placed on multiple lines, like this:
                     â–¶ {example}

    Klingon words and phrases must be in brackets, like this: {tlhIngan Hol}. Part of speech may
    be specified with ":", like this: {tlhIngan Hol:n}. This will cause the part of speech to be
    displayed, e.g., "(n)", where appropriate in the app. Also, links will go to such an entry
    directly, instead of attempting to analyse its components. Components may be explicitly
    specified by using "@@", like this: {tlhIngan Hol:n@@tlhIngan:n, Hol:n}. If part of speech
    is not specified, links will behave the same as if the user had typed in the query (so that
    for example the user can edit the search query). Homophones which are the same part of speech
    can be identified by a number, like {ghIt:n:1} and {ghIt:n:2}. The number "0" can be used to
    return all matching homophones belonging to the same part of speech. A "h" after the number
    suppresses the display of that number, e.g., {jIH:n:1} will display as "jIH (def'n 1)" whereas
    {jIH:n:1h} will display as "jIH".

    Note: Be careful to use American spellings, e.g., "honor", "color",
          "-ization". Canadian spellings should be added under "search_tags".
